# Metabolic Physiology in Isolation Talk

Below is a talk Dave gave about his work on muscle mTORC1 and metabolism at the [#METPHYS2020](https://twitter.com/hashtag/METPHYS2020?src=hash) online seminar series during the COVID-19 epidemic.

This work is based on the paper (currently a preprint) led by [Erin](http://bridgeslab.sph.umich.edu/people/erin-stephenson/) that can be found on BioRxiv: [Skeletal Muscle mTORC1 Activation Increases Energy Expenditure and Reduces Longevity in Mice](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/720540).

These talks were put on by the [White-McGarrah lab](https://sites.google.com/view/whitemcgarrahlab/home?authuser=0) and a full list of all the excellent talks are posted on [Facebook](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fwhitemcgarrahlab.dmpi.7&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFQhrB_zz5pURCXZaFB3JJhq7xfNw) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq7E6bgYhNIateEYuhrAQQw) if you missed the livestream.  You might want to fast forward about 30 minutes for each talk.  

Thanks to [Phil](https://twitter.com/phillipwhite14) for setting this up and giving us the venue to speak!
